### **7-Day Zero-to-Hero: Kotlin**

#### **Day 1: Introduction to Kotlin and Setup**
- **Goal**: Understand the Kotlin programming language basics and set up your development environment.
  
- **Topics**:
  - What is Kotlin and why use it?
  - Setting up Kotlin using **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Android Studio**.
  - Basic **Kotlin syntax**, variables, and types.
  
- **Tasks**:
  - Write a simple "Hello World" Kotlin program.
  - Experiment with variables, data types, and printing values.

#### **Day 2: Control Flow and Functions**
- **Goal**: Learn how to use control flow statements and define functions in Kotlin.
  
- **Topics**:
  - **Conditional statements**: `if-else`, `when`.
  - **Loops**: `for`, `while`, and iterating over collections.
  - Defining and calling **functions** in Kotlin.
  
- **Tasks**:
  - Write a program that uses conditional statements and loops.
  - Create functions with different return types and parameters.

#### **Day 3: Object-Oriented Programming in Kotlin**
- **Goal**: Understand object-oriented programming (OOP) in Kotlin.
  
- **Topics**:
  - Defining **classes**, objects, and constructors.
  - Using **inheritance**, **interfaces**, and **abstract classes**.
  - Understanding **data classes** and Kotlin-specific OOP features like `sealed` classes.
  
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a class representing a real-world object (e.g., a car or a person).
  - Implement inheritance and create multiple subclasses.

#### **Day 4: Kotlin Collections and Functional Programming**
- **Goal**: Learn about Kotlin’s collection framework and functional programming features.
  
- **Topics**:
  - Working with **lists**, **maps**, and **sets**.
  - **Higher-order functions**, **lambdas**, and functional programming concepts.
  
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a program that uses lists and maps.
  - Use higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` to manipulate collections.

#### **Day 5: Coroutines and Asynchronous Programming**
- **Goal**: Understand how to use coroutines for asynchronous programming in Kotlin.
  
- **Topics**:
  - Introduction to **coroutines**.
  - Using `launch`, `async`, and `await` for asynchronous tasks.
  
- **Tasks**:
  - Write a program that uses coroutines to run tasks concurrently.
  - Implement a simple example of fetching data asynchronously using coroutines.

#### **Day 6: Working with APIs (Kotlin for Android or JVM)**
- **Goal**: Learn how to make network requests and work with APIs using Kotlin.
  
- **Topics**:
  - Making **HTTP requests** using libraries like `Ktor` or `Retrofit`.
  - Handling JSON data with Kotlin’s serialization or `Gson`.
  
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a Kotlin program that fetches data from a public API (e.g., weather API).
  - Parse and display the JSON data returned from the API.

#### **Day 7: Building a Small Kotlin Project**
- **Goal**: Apply what you've learned to build a small Kotlin project and deploy it.
  
- **Topics**:
  - Final project: A console-based app or an Android app (if using Kotlin for Android).
  - Deploying the project (for Android, you can test the app on a device or emulator).
  
- **Tasks**:
  - Build a small console or Android app with networking capabilities.
  - For Android, build and run your app on an emulator or real device.
